First of all need to clone project, using this command - https://github.com/ekaTolk1006/Entaint-task.git

There are two directories in the project - client(front-end), server(proxy-server)
Should go to the client and enter "npm i" command to install all dependencies and then repeat the same in the server directory.

Project starting: 
To start the server should use command: npm run dev;
When server started should start React application, go to the client direction and run: npm run dev;
